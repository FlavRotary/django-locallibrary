# django-locallibrary
Implementation of Django Tutorial by Mozilla MDN

"LocalLibrary is the name of the website that we'll create and evolve over the course of this series of tutorials. As you'd expect, the purpose of the website is to provide an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts."

Tutorial objectives:
- Use Django's tools to create a skeleton website and application.
- Start and stop the development server.
- Create models to represent your application's data.
- Use the Django admin site to populate your site's data.
- Create views to retrieve specific data in response to different requests, and templates to render the data as HTML to be displayed in the browser.
- Create mappers to associate different URL patterns with specific views.
- Add user authorization and sessions to control site behavior and access.
- Work with forms.
- Write test code for your app.
- Use Django's security effectively.
- Deploy your application to production.
